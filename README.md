# Quick Copy
This mod allows you to quickly copy stuff on screen to your clipboard for pasting into chat!

# Usage
## System Position
Click on a system so it is full screen. Then, type in `/claim` in chat to have its position copied to your clipboard, like this 

`system BAMA (237, 120) in Galvanie`

You can then paste this in your faction's system-reservation chat, spotted enemy chat, etc.

# Install
Dump this file into `Rising Constellation/dist/main`. Make sure to also have its dependency, [RCMA](https://github.com/grnt426/RC-Mod-API).
